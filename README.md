## Description

The purpose of this project was to allow a manager the ability to generate a webpage that displays their team's basic info. It gives them a way to quickly access common information like their name and email address while also allowing the manager to see specific information. For Interns the manager is able to see their school. For engineers the manager is able to see their GitHub username. The app also allows the manager to enter their office number incase the employees need to locate them.
